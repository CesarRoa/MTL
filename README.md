**Project Name:** [ROA]MTL1
**Starting Date:** July 29th 2024
**Primary Language:** HTML
**Secundary Language:** CSS
**Dev Signature**: ROAC

**Description**
Targeting the skills in HTML to build a web page by using mostly this language. 
The use of <Frameset> is depricated at this moment, but many old web sites were created with this, and it is a great first example of our skills in the backbone of web programming.

**Notes**

<Frameset> tag requires the use of <Frame> tag inside it. For this example, the whole page will have three Frames: Title, Menu, Body. Each one has their own name and src parameter set. 
For the links, to change an specific frame, the parameter *target* needs to be set, as in this example:
<a href="./opcionA.html" target="bodyFrame">opcion a</a>
